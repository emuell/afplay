## afplay

**afplay** is a cross-platform *audio playback library for Rust*, based on jpochyla's [psst-core](https://github.com/jpochyla/psst/tree/master/psst-core) audio playback implementation.

It aims to be a suitable player for game engines, but can also be used as a general-purpose playback engine for other types of music applications.<br>
It was originally developed and is used in the [AFEC-Explorer](https://github.com/emuell/AFEC-Explorer) app and related projects which are using the excellent [Tauri](https://tauri.app) app framework.

### Features

- Play, seek, stop, mix and monitor playback of preloaded or on-the-fly decoded (streamed) *audio files*.
- Play, stop, mix and monitor playback of custom *synth tones* thanks to [dasp](https://github.com/RustAudio/dasp) (can be optionally enabled).
- Audio output for Windows, macOS and Linux is handled via [cpal](https://github.com/RustAudio/cpal) or [cubeb](https://github.com/mozilla/cubeb).
- Decodes and thus plays back *most common audio file formats*, thanks to [Symphonia](https://github.com/pdeljanov/Symphonia).
- Files are *automatically resampled* and *channel mapped* to the audio output's signal specs, thanks to [libsamplerate](https://github.com/RamiHg/rust-libsamplerate).

### Examples

See [example directory](./examples) for some more working examples. 

```rust
use afplay::{
    AudioFilePlayer, AudioOutput, AudioSink, DefaultAudioOutput,
    file::FilePlaybackOptions, playback::PlaybackStatusEvent, 
};

use dasp::Signal;

// Open the default audio device (via cpal or cubeb, whatever is enabled as output feature)
let audio_output = DefaultAudioOutput::open()?;
let audio_sink = audio_output.sink();
// Memorize the device's actual sample rate (needed for the synth example)
let sample_rate = audio_sink.sample_rate();

// Create an optional channel to receive playback status events ("Position", "Stopped" events)
let (playback_status_sender, playback_status_receiver) = crossbeam_channel::unbounded();
// Create a player and transfer ownership of the audio output to the player. The player will play,
// mix down and manage all files and synth sources for us from here.
let mut player = AudioFilePlayer::new(audio_sink, Some(playback_status_sender));

// We'll start playing a file now: The file below is going to be "preloaded" because it uses the
// default playback options. Preloaded means it's entirely decoded first, then played back from
// a buffer.
// Files played through the player are automatically resampled and channel-mapped to match the
// audio output's signal specs, so there's nothing more to do to get it played:
let small_file_id = player.play_file("PATH_TO/some_small_file.wav")?;
// The next file is going to be decoded and streamed on the fly, which is handy for very long
// files such as music, as it can start playing right away and won't need to allocate memory
// for the entire file. As the player mixes down all playing files, we'll hear both files at the
// same time now:
let long_file_id = player.play_file_with_options(
    "PATH_TO/some_long_file.mp3",
    FilePlaybackOptions::default().streamed().with_volume(0.5),
)?;

// !! NB: optional `dasp-synth` feature needs to be enabled for the following to work !!
// Let's play a simple synth tone as well. You can play any dasp::Signal here. The passed signal 
// will be wrapped in a dasp::signal::UntilExhausted, so this can be used to easily create 
// one-shots. The example below plays a sine wave for two secs at 440hz.
let dasp_signal = dasp::signal::from_iter(
    dasp::signal::rate(sample_rate as f64)
        .const_hz(440.0)
        .sine()
        .take(sample_rate as usize * 2),
);
let synth_id = player.play_dasp_synth(dasp_signal, "my_synth_sound")?;

// You can optionally track playback status events from the player as well:
std::thread::spawn(move || {
    while let Ok(event) = playback_status_receiver.recv() {
        match event {
            PlaybackStatusEvent::Position { id, path, position } => {
                println!(
                    "Playback pos of source #{} '{}': {}",
                    id,
                    path,
                    position.as_secs_f32()
                );
            }
            PlaybackStatusEvent::Stopped {
                id,
                path,
                exhausted,
            } => {
                if exhausted {
                    println!("Playback of #{} '{}' finished", id, path);
                } else {
                    println!("Playback of #{} '{}' was stopped", id, path);
                }
            }
        }
    }
});

// Playing files can be seeked or stopped:
player.seek_source(long_file_id, std::time::Duration::from_secs(5))?;
player.stop_source(small_file_id)?;
// Synths can not be seeked, but they can be stopped.
player.stop_source(synth_id)?;

// If you only want one file to play at the same time, simply stop all playing
// sounds before starting a new one:
player.stop_all_sources()?;
player.play_file("PATH_TO/boom.wav")?;
```
