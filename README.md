# afplay

**afplay** is an *audio playback library for Rust*, based on the
[psst-core](https://github.com/jpochyla/psst/tree/master/psst-core) audio playback
implementation.

It aims to be a suitable audio player backend for game engines, but can also serve
as a general-purpose low-latency music and sound playback engine for desktop music apps.

It was originally developed and is used in the [AFEC-Explorer](https://github.com/emuell/AFEC-Explorer)
app and related projects which are using the [Tauri](https://tauri.app) app framework.

### Features

- Play, seek, stop, mix and monitor playback of **preloaded** (buffered) or **streamed**
  (on-the-fly decoded) **audio files**.
- Play, stop, mix and monitor playback of **custom synth tones** thanks to
  [dasp](https://github.com/RustAudio/dasp) (optional feature: disabled by default).
- Play audio on Windows, macOS and Linux via [cpal](https://github.com/RustAudio/cpal) or
  [cubeb](https://github.com/mozilla/cubeb) (cpal is enabled by default).
- Decodes and thus plays back most **common audio file formats**, thanks to
  [Symphonia](https://github.com/pdeljanov/Symphonia).
- Files are automatically **resampled and channel mapped** to the audio output's signal specs,
  thanks to [libsamplerate](https://github.com/Prior99/libsamplerate-sys).
- Click free playback: when stopping sounds, a very short volume fade-out is applied to
  **avoid clicks**.
- Sample precise playback scheduling, e.g. to play samples in a **sequencer**.

 to generate **waveform plots** from audio file paths or raw sample buffers.

### Examples

See [/examples](https://github.com/emuell/afplay/tree/master/examples) directory for more examples.

#### Simple Audio Playback

Play and stop audio files on the system's default audio output device.

```rust
use afplay::{
    AudioFilePlayer, AudioOutput, AudioSink, DefaultAudioOutput,
    FilePlaybackOptions, Error
};

// Open the default audio device (cpal or cubeb, depending on the enabled output feature)
let audio_output = DefaultAudioOutput::open()?;
// Create a player and transfer ownership of the audio output to the player.
let mut player = AudioFilePlayer::new(audio_output.sink(), None);

// Play back a file with the default playback options.
player.play_file(
   "PATH_TO/some_file.wav",
    FilePlaybackOptions::default())?;
// Play back another file on top with custom playback options.
player.play_file(
    "PATH_TO/some_long_file.mp3",
    FilePlaybackOptions::default()
        .streamed() // decodes the file on-the-fly
        .volume_db(-6.0) // lower the volume a bit
        .speed(0.5) // play file at half the speed
        .repeat(2), // repeat, loop it 2 times
)?;

// Stop all playing files: this will quickly fade-out all playing files to avoid clicks.
player.stop_all_sources()?;
```

#### Advanced Audio Playback

Play, seek and stop audio files and synth sounds on the default audio output device.
Monitor playback status of playing files and synth tones.

```rust
use afplay::{
    AudioFilePlayer, AudioOutput, AudioSink, DefaultAudioOutput,
    AudioFilePlaybackStatusEvent, FilePlaybackOptions, SynthPlaybackOptions,
    Error
};

#[cfg(feature = "dasp")]
use dasp::Signal;

// Open the default audio device (cpal or cubeb, depending on the enabled output feature)
let audio_output = DefaultAudioOutput::open()?;

// Create an optional channel to receive playback status events ("Position", "Stopped" events)
let (playback_status_sender, playback_status_receiver) = crossbeam_channel::unbounded();
// Create a player and transfer ownership of the audio output to the player. The player will
// play, mix down and manage all files and synth sources for us from here.
let mut player = AudioFilePlayer::new(audio_output.sink(), Some(playback_status_sender));

// We'll start playing a file now: The file below is going to be "preloaded" because it uses
// the default playback options. Preloaded means it's entirely decoded first, then played back
// from a buffer.
// Files played through the player are automatically resampled and channel-mapped to match the
// audio output's signal specs, so there's nothing more to do to get it played:
let small_file_id = player.play_file(
    "PATH_TO/some_small_file.wav",
    FilePlaybackOptions::default())?;
// The next file is going to be decoded and streamed on the fly, which is especially handy for
// long files such as music, as it can start playing right away and won't need to allocate
// memory for the entire file.
// We're also repeating the file playback 2 times, lowering the volume and are pitching it
// down. As the player mixes down everything, we'll hear both files at the same time now:
let long_file_id = player.play_file(
    "PATH_TO/some_long_file.mp3",
    FilePlaybackOptions::default()
        .streamed()
        .volume_db(-6.0)
        .speed(0.5)
        .repeat(2),
)?;

// !! NB: optional `dasp-synth` feature needs to be enabled for the following to work !!
// Let's play a simple synth tone as well. You can play any dasp::Signal here. The passed
// signal will be wrapped in a dasp::signal::UntilExhausted, so this can be used to create
// one-shots. The example below plays a sine wave for two secs at 440hz.
#[cfg(feature = "dasp")]
let sample_rate = player.output_sample_rate();
#[cfg(feature = "dasp")]
let dasp_signal = dasp::signal::from_iter(
    dasp::signal::rate(sample_rate as f64)
        .const_hz(440.0)
        .sine()
        .take(sample_rate as usize * 2),
);
#[cfg(feature = "dasp")]
let synth_id = player.play_dasp_synth(
    dasp_signal,
    "my_synth_sound",
    SynthPlaybackOptions::default())?;

// You can optionally track playback status events from the player:
std::thread::spawn(move || {
    while let Ok(event) = playback_status_receiver.recv() {
        match event {
            AudioFilePlaybackStatusEvent::Position { 
                id, 
                path, 
                context: _, 
                position 
            } => {
                println!(
                    "Playback pos of source #{} '{}': {}",
                    id,
                    path,
                    position.as_secs_f32()
                );
            }
            AudioFilePlaybackStatusEvent::Stopped {
                id,
                path,
                context: _,
                exhausted,
            } => {
                if exhausted {
                    println!("Playback of #{} '{}' finished", id, path);
                } else {
                    println!("Playback of #{} '{}' was stopped", id, path);
                }
            }
        }
    }
});

// Playing files can be seeked or stopped:
player.seek_source(long_file_id, std::time::Duration::from_secs(5))?;
player.stop_source(small_file_id)?;

// Synths can not be seeked, but they can be stopped.
#[cfg(feature = "dasp")]
player.stop_source(synth_id)?;

// If you only want one file to play at the same time, simply stop all playing
// sounds before starting a new one:
player.stop_all_sources()?;
player.play_file("PATH_TO/boom.wav", FilePlaybackOptions::default())?;

```

#### Playback Sequencing

Play a sample file sequence in time with e.g. musical beats.

```rust
use afplay::{
   source::file::preloaded::PreloadedFileSource, utils::speed_from_note, AudioFilePlayer,
   AudioOutput, DefaultAudioOutput, Error, FilePlaybackOptions,
};

// create a player
let mut player = AudioFilePlayer::new(DefaultAudioOutput::open()?.sink(), None);

// calculate at which rate the sample file should be emitted
let beats_per_min = 120.0;
let samples_per_sec = player.output_sample_rate();
let samples_per_beat = samples_per_sec as f64 * 60.0 / beats_per_min as f64;

// preload a sample file
let preloaded_sample_source = PreloadedFileSource::new(
    "path/to_some_file.wav",
    None, // we don't need a channel for playback events
    FilePlaybackOptions::default(),
    samples_per_sec,
)?;

// schedule playback of the sample file every beat for 8 beats
let playback_start = player.output_sample_frame_position();
for beat_counter in 0..8 {
    // when is the next beat playback due?
    let next_beats_sample_time =
        (playback_start as f64 + beat_counter as f64 * samples_per_beat()) as u64;
    // play a clone of the preloaded sample at the next beat's sample time.
    // cloning is very cheap as the sample buffer is shared...
    player.play_file_source(
        preloaded_sample_source.clone(
            FilePlaybackOptions::default()
              .speed(speed_from_note(60)), // middle-c
            samples_per_sec)?,
        Some(next_beats_sample_time),
    )?;
}
```
